    <h1 class="blue">Julia Quinn, The Historical Romance Novelist</h1>
    <p>Julia Quinn was a Harvard graduate who graduated with an Art History degree. Shortly after, she decided to pursue pre-med at Yale to become a doctor. During her first two years of pre-med she wrote two romance novels, in which, went into a bidding war with two publishing companies. She then dropped out of med-school, and worked full-time writing romance novels. Today, she has over 18 consecutive New York Times bestsellers. One book, Bridgerton, has turned into a Shondaland/Netflix original which debuted in December of 2020, becoming Netflixâ€™s fifth most successful series.</p>
